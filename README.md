# Mesa_Daniela_MT-FIP

##Description

MT-FIP Project created by Daniela Mesa.

For this midterm I had to join 2 brands (Pamper Expression Wipes and Michelob Ultra). This web page is composed of 5 pages: Home, Products, Advertisement, About and Contact.

The focus of the homepage is basically to show what and who the brand is in the first place.

The product page contains the different beers (of different brands) to give allusion to different flavors and presentations.

On the advertisement page there are some promotions of the brand in different aspects such as t-shirts, linings, labels, etc. 

Finally there is the contact page in which the client is expected to communicate with the company and / or be aware of what he grills with the brand. Includes a location map to better locate customers
